The major difference - null is explicit while undefined is implicit. 

Let's say we have a variable and we don't have a value associated with that, so that makes it undefined but null is set as the value to explicitly indicate “no value”. 

undefined is used when the nothing is "not" known, and null is used when the nothing is known.

Null

If a variable is null then it means the variable has no value and that it was explicitly set to have no value by the programmer. A variable will never be null unless somewhere in the code a programmer set a variable to null.

This is important to know since when you see a null value you know that the programmer who wrote that code is telling you there is no value explicitly

Undefined

On the other hand undefined means that there is no value because no value has been set yet. 

For example, if you create a variable and do not assign it a value then it will be undefined

let a

console.log(a)
// undefined

console.log(null == undefined)
// true
console.log(null === undefined)
// false
